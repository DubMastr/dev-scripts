This is a loose collection of miscellaneous scripts (mostly Bash or Ruby) for development work with Git and Hg version control, Gerrit code review, and the Android OS.

The scripts are tested best with the "Git Bash" that comes with "Git for Windows" but should run just fine under Linux and / or Mac OS X.
